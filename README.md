=============

Basic quick-start template for making HTML5 games

### Installation

Installation is dead easy and assumes you have already installed node.js and npm.

Download and extract the template and cd into it from the command line.

    npm install    

Done? Awesome.

### Running

Now, still at the root directory, we can either run the following command:

    npm start    

Done!

### Building

You can build a standalone js file with

    npm run build

And you can build a minified version with

    npm run prod

### Cleaning

Just do this to delete the built files:

    npm run clean
